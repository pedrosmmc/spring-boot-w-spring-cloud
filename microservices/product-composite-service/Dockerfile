#INFO: To handle the extraction of the fat-jar file in the Dockerfile we use a multi-stage build, meaning that there is a first step, named builder, that handles the extraction. The second stage builds the actual Docker image that will be used at runtime, picking the files as required from the first stage. Using this technique, we can handle all packaging logic in the Dockerfile but at the same time keep the size of the final Docker image to a minimum
